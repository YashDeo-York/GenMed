This repository accompanies the paper **"Comparing Generative Metrics for Medical Imaging with Clinical Utility"**. It provides a Python package for evaluating generative models in the context of medical imaging. The package implements both upstream metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) and downstream clinical utility evaluations (e.g., tumor segmentation accuracy, vessel detection).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Evaluate generative medical images using a wide range of metrics, from traditional image quality measures to clinical utility assessments.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend the package to include custom metrics or new modalities.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple APIs for evaluating generated medical images across multiple datasets.
- **Reproducibility**: Includes test cases and example scripts to ensure reproducibility.
